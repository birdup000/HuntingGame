# 3D Hunting Simulator Game Design Document

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the architecture and specifications for a 3D hunting simulator game developed in Python. The game will simulate realistic hunting experiences with features such as player movement, aiming, shooting, animal behavior, terrain generation, and a user interface. The design emphasizes modularity to facilitate easy implementation and future extensions.

## 2. Library Selection
After research, the following Python libraries are recommended:
- **Panda3D**: A powerful 3D game engine with robust rendering, physics, and animation capabilities. Suitable for complex 3D simulations.
- **Ursina**: A simpler, beginner-friendly 3D engine built on top of Panda3D, ideal for rapid prototyping and easier learning curve.
- **Additional Libraries**:
  - **NumPy**: For mathematical computations in terrain generation and physics.
  - **Pygame**: For 2D UI elements and input handling if needed.
  - **OpenSimplex**: For procedural terrain generation.

**Selected Primary Library**: Panda3D for its comprehensive features and performance in 3D simulations.

## 3. Key Features and Mechanics

### 3.1 Player Mechanics
- **Movement**: First-person movement with walking, running, crouching, and jumping. Include stamina system affecting speed.
- **Aiming**: Mouse-based camera control with zoom functionality for scoped weapons.
- **Shooting**: Realistic ballistics with bullet drop, wind effects, and accuracy based on weapon type and player stability.
- **Inventory**: Management of weapons, ammunition, and gear.

### 3.2 Animal Behavior
- **AI System**: Animals with states (idle, foraging, fleeing, alerted). Use finite state machines for behavior.
- **Detection**: Animals detect players based on sound, sight, and smell with configurable ranges.
- **Movement**: Realistic animal locomotion with pathfinding around obstacles.

### 3.3 Terrain Generation
- **Procedural Generation**: Use noise functions to create varied landscapes with hills, forests, and water bodies.
- **Biomes**: Different environments affecting animal spawns and player movement (e.g., dense forest vs. open field).

### 3.4 User Interface
- **HUD**: Display health, ammunition, mini-map, and objectives.
- **Menus**: Main menu, pause menu, inventory screen, and settings.
- **Feedback**: Visual and audio cues for hits, misses, and environmental interactions.
